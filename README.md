This is a Matlab toolbox builded by XinNoil

# Usage
- Open pathdef.m, add `C:\Path\MyMatlabTools` and `C:\Path\MyMatlabTools\IndoorLoc`the path to pathdef.m, like:

```
function p = pathdef
%PATHDEF Search path defaults.
%   PATHDEF returns a string that can be used as input to MATLABPATH
%   in order to set the path.

# Function

```
function theta=get_angle(P1,P2)
% Get angle of the vector between two points
% getAngle(P1,P2) is the angle of P1 -> P2
% (x,y)


function theta=getAngle(P1,P2)
% Get angle of the vector between two points
% getAngle(P1,P2) is the angle of P1 -> P2
% (y,x)

function theta=getIncludedAngle(a1,a2)
% Get angle of the two vectors
